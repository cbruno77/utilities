Various usefull bits of code, put online for public sharing. Included amongst others:

* some shell scripts for creating and undoing git/maven project releases
* some old analyze-tweet code I used for writing one of my blogs (superseeded by my analyze-tweets project)
* some xslt 2.0 scripts for enriching primitive layout-oriented XML scraped out of PDF into (more) meaningful MLX
